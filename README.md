# regex-tutorial
The motivation behind this project was to help fellow web development students use a tutorial for regex information.
## Installation:
Created by me through VS Code
## Link to my repo:
https://github.com/Starkoiii/regex-tutorial

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile

## Usage
A web development student could use a tutorial explaining a specific regex
so they can understand the search pattern the regex defines
